## Day 3 | Virtual Machines

#### General Example:
You have a 1acre of land and you are living happily.
You are a family of 5 members and do not require entire 1acre of land to live.
Instead, you partition 1acre into 2 halfs. 1 half for you and other half for Rent.
This way you are efficiently using the 1acre land.

### What is the problem?
Let's say you have purchased some Servers with each 100GB and 100Core processors. Your applications might have at max 10GB and are deployed onto Servers. The rest 90GB of the server is unused. This leads to INEFFICIENCY.
Not using the Server resource productively is like a crime.

### Virtualization
To overcome INEFFICIENCY of Server usage.
- Virtualization is a concept of using Hypervisor (a software that helps in creation of virtual machines) on physical server to create logical server/logical partitions.
- Each logical server will have its own memory, hardware and cpu.
- Top most hypervisors used are VMWare, Xen etc.
- Hence, using Virtualization helps to improve efficiently.
